# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline (AWS Free Tier)
Zero‑cost, serverless MLOps pipeline with CI/CD, IaC, and monitoring — built on AWS Free Tier + Hugging Face.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a production‑style MLOps pipeline built entirely on free‑tier resources.  
It bridges the gap between **ML research and cloud production**, showing recruiters how modern pipelines can be reproducible, automated, and cost‑efficient.

---

## 🚀 Pipeline Stages
1. **Data ingestion & preprocessing** (S3, Hugging Face Datasets)  
2. **Training** (LoRA fine‑tuning, FP16 mixed precision)  
3. **Evaluation** (accuracy gates, reproducibility checks)  
4. **CI/CD automation** (GitHub Actions workflows)  
5. **Deployment** (Hugging Face Hub, AWS Lambda/ECS)  
6. **Monitoring** (CloudWatch metrics, drift detection)

## 📊 Results

| Environment        | Epochs | Train Samples | Eval Samples | Accuracy | Eval Loss | Eval Runtime | Samples/sec | Steps/sec |
|--------------------|--------|---------------|--------------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| GitHub Actions (CI/CD) | 2 | 5,000 | 1,000 | **86.0%** | 0.3372 | ~5h | 3.218 | 0.203 |
| Colab GPU (manual) | 3 | 5,000 | 1,000 | **85.3%** | 0.3209 | ~30m | 63.7 | 4.018 |

**Summary:**  
- CI/CD run achieved **86.0% accuracy**, proving automation and reproducibility.  
- Colab run achieved **85.3% accuracy** in ~30 minutes, ideal for rapid iteration.
